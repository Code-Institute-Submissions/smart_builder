## Description

This is a web app designed to link people who need to find tradesmen for construction jobs. It gives the clients the options to post a job and then tradesmen will be able to send quotes for the job. The web app has two levels of authentication, one for clients looking for a job and the other for tradesmen looking for a job with different levels of accessibility.
